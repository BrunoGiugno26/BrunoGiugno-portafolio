    description: "Reduced delivery times by 35% with real-time tracking dashboard serving 10K+ daily users",
    longDescription: `A comprehensive logistics management platform that revolutionized how the company tracks and manages their fleet operations. Built with React, TypeScript, and real-time WebSocket connections, this dashboard processes over 50,000 shipments monthly while maintaining 99.9% uptime.

The platform integrates with multiple third-party APIs, provides real-time GPS tracking, and features an intuitive drag-and-drop interface for route optimization. The system has directly contributed to €2M+ in cost savings through improved efficiency and reduced delivery times.`,
    problem: `The client was struggling with inefficient logistics operations, manual route planning, and lack of real-time visibility into their fleet. Drivers were using paper-based systems, dispatchers had no real-time tracking, and customers frequently complained about delayed deliveries. The existing system was a legacy desktop application that couldn't scale with their growing business needs.`,
    solution: `I architected and developed a modern web-based dashboard that provides real-time fleet tracking, automated route optimization, and comprehensive analytics. The solution includes a mobile-responsive interface for drivers, a dispatch center for operations teams, and executive dashboards for management. Key features include real-time GPS tracking, geofencing alerts, automated dispatch, and predictive analytics for route optimization.`,
